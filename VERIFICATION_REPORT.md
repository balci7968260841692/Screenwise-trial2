# Verification Report

This check reviews the `please_work` branch to see whether the "AI-Enhanced Screen Time Manager" behaves as described in the project brief. Because the repository deliberately omits the Android SDK, the Gradle wrapper JAR, and any Supabase credentials, no Gradle or device builds can run inside this sandbox. The observations below are therefore based on static code inspection.

## Runtime prerequisites still required
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` is missing, so `./gradlew` cannot execute until you regenerate it locally with `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.14.3 --distribution-type=bin` and avoid committing the binary. 【F:gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties†L1-L7】
- The project expects an Android 36 SDK and Build Tools 36.0.0 registered in `local.properties`; those directories are not present in the repo, so compilation cannot start here. 【F:README_ANDROID.md†L42-L74】
- Supabase URL/key and Gemini API key must be supplied via `local.properties` and Supabase environment variables before network-backed features function. 【F:README_ANDROID.md†L106-L148】

## Functional gaps identified in code
- The accessibility guard (`UsageGuardService`) contains only placeholder comments and never evaluates active apps or launches the Shield UI, so real screen-time enforcement is not implemented. 【F:app/src/main/java/com/example/screentimemanager/service/UsageGuardService.kt†L6-L13】
- The foreground monitoring service starts a notification but performs no usage tracking, WorkManager scheduling, or recovery logic after process death. 【F:app/src/main/java/com/example/screentimemanager/service/UsageMonitorForegroundService.kt†L13-L35】
- The Shield flow renders a Compose dialog that simply closes the activity; it does not capture the user’s reason, invoke the override repositories, or route to the AI negotiation path. 【F:app/src/main/java/com/example/screentimemanager/ui/screens/shield/ShieldActivity.kt†L21-L45】【F:app/src/main/java/com/example/screentimemanager/ui/screens/shield/OverrideDialog.kt†L18-L47】
- The Home screen hard-codes a demo override request (fixed package, minutes, and context) instead of reflecting per-app usage or limits, so end users cannot assign or adjust their own screen-time within the UI. 【F:app/src/main/java/com/example/screentimemanager/ui/screens/home/HomeScreen.kt†L32-L57】

## What *is* implemented
- Repository and domain layers compute trust adjustments, evaluate overrides against Supabase/Gemini responses, and persist results, indicating the negotiation backend contracts are wired. 【F:app/src/main/java/com/example/screentimemanager/data/repository/OverridesRepository.kt†L22-L141】
- The Supabase Edge Function targets Gemini’s `gemini-pro` model and returns structured JSON for negotiation and coaching, matching the documented API contract. 【F:supabase/functions/ai_negotiation/index.ts†L63-L156】

## Conclusion
The branch contains the architectural scaffolding, negotiation logic, and documentation, but critical enforcement and UI flows remain placeholders. After you supply the required SDK/Gradle assets, the app will compile, yet it still will not "work exactly as supposed" until the guard service, override dialog, and limit management screens are fully implemented. Additional development and manual device testing are necessary to deliver the promised behaviour.
